# Experimenting-with-HTML-CSS-JS
<br>
This is a webpage I created to help me learn HTML, CSS, JS and Jquery.
<br>
The purpose wasn't to create a beautiful website, but to experiment with creating an online store. Clicking the pictures will add that "painting" to your cart and ordering them will take you to PayPal login to complete the order.
